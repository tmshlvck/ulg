ULG version 0.9
- development started in June 2012
- sponsored by CZ.NIC (http://www.nic.cz)
- intention is to create a versatile Looking Glass for various routers
- genshi and cherrypy was used in the beginning
- cherrypy was later dropped and simple CGI was used instead
- the CGI scripts currently do not support mod_python nor mod_wsgi

Basic installation procedure is:

1) install prerequisites: Python 2.6 or 2.7, Genshi, Python CGI module, urllib,
   pexpect and pygraph and GraphViz
2) install additional router-specific prerequisities:
 - JuniperRouterRemoteTelnet: Telnet
 - CiscoRouter: OpenSSH client
 - BirdRouterRemote: OpenSSH client (default)
3) deploy files in src directory to some place in WWW tree
4) mkdir /etc/ulg; cp config.py.example /etc/ulg/config.py
5) edit config.py to set up routers and credentials
6) edit defaults.py to set up correct paths toward bins
7) create .htaccess file with following contents:

<FilesMatch "(.pyc|.*~)">
  Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

Options +ExecCGI
AddHandler cgi-script .py

(Or use corresponding config of your web server.)

7) access http://yourserver/path-to-ulg/ulg.py via browser
8) change strings and templates in defaults.py and templates/*.html .

Procedure for Debian Squeeze/Wheezy and Linux Mint 14 (nadia):
1)
apt-get install python python-pexpect python-pygraph python-genshi libgv-python whois

All other steps are the same as in generic case.

Future plans:

This "pre-release" is only a preview and "technology demonstrator". Requests and contributions are welcomed. I indend to support BIRD (http://bird.network.cz) and Cisco routers and switches and support typical BGP-related commands and also IGP and L2 management commands in order to make LG more useful for ordinary NOC staff especially for information aquisition during outages and problems.
